Bug-Finder



This simple, easy-to-use GUI application takes two source codes, executes them against a common input and compares their stdout output.
This project is mainly targeted for the competitive programmers, who find it boring to hunt down a small bug which stands as an obstruction between a WA and an AC.


To run this project,
1. Download the jar file (JinglingJava.jar) from /dist/
2. Open the folder containing the jar file from the terminal.
3. Type the following command :
    java -jar "JinglingJava.jar"
4. A GUI window should open. Select the source codes and the input file and hit "Run".


Features :
1. Simple and clean. Easy to use.
2. Currently supported languages : C++, Java and Python (2 & 3).
3. You can select a test case generating code to run your code(s) against random test cases.
4. You can test your code(s) against custom test cases.
5. You can also select an existing test file.
6. The generated output file can be directly suubmitted when required. (Several competitions like Facebook Hackercup, Google Kickstart etc. require you to submit the output file along with the source code).


The Source Code can be found at /src/Bug_Finder.java
